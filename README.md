# Senior-Design-Capstone
### Project Name: CUrPLAN


### Problem Statement:  
We are a team of 4 undergraduate students who have struggled with planning which classes to take each semester in order to graduate with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science. Every semester as students, we all have to figure out what classes we need and want to take for the next semester to stay on track with obtaining our degrees in ‘n’ years (‘n’ being the ideal number of years the students want to graduate and obtain their degree) while trying to figure out our career journeys. Currently, CU Denver's Computer Science and Engineering Department offers resources such as advisors, the degree audit, a pdf of the list of elective courses available for the upcoming semester, a degree map, and the registration cart to find and add classes. The current issue is, all these resources are available to us, but it is really hard to obtain and keep the resources together since they come either from our school emails, UCDAccess, and on the CU Denver website. It is also somewhat time consuming to figure out how far along we are with completing our degree, finding which requirements we still need to fulfill, and what classes will satisfy those requirement, while lining it up with our other responsibilities outside of university. We plan to create an application that will help current students save time on figuring out which classes to take each semester and use it to help create unique degree plans for students to graduate with a BS in Computer Science on time.

#### Goals:
- After Fall 2021, we will have the basic functional prototype done and working. This prototype will be our MVP that will satisfy these basic requirements:  
  1) A user interface that displays a degree map for the BS CS degree (which is similar to the degree chart given by the CS department). The map will allow users to interact with the degree map, and show which CS classes they have already fulfilled and which CS classes/credits they need to take to stay on track for graduating in 4 years.  
  2) The user will be able to add/remove courses to their degree map, creating a unique plan for them to graduate on time.  
  3) Each course will indicate whether it is a prerequisite, a class that needs to be taken before other classes can be taken, and display which class the course is a prequisite for. Each class will also list prerequisite courses in the description if there are courses that need to be taken before.  
  4) Each course will have a basic description about what is taught in the course.  
- After Spring 2022, will will have a working application with 4 additional features:  
  1) Courses will indicate which category of CS courses it belongs to (CS core, CS systems core, capstone, scientific computing breadth, data science breadth, system software breadth, secure computing breadth, technical electives)  
  2) Application allows user to adjust plan based on how many years they want to graduate in.  
  3) The application will include constraints in adding/updating courses to the degree plan. This includes courses that are only available fall/spring, fall/spring/summer, fall, and spring.
